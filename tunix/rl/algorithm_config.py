  """Configuration for GRPO algorithms.

  Attributes:
    algo_variant: The algorithm variant to use. Default: `grpo`.
    advantage_estimator: The advantage estimator to use. Default: `grpo`.
    policy_loss_fn: The policy loss function to use. Default: `grpo`.
    loss_agg_mode: The aggregation mode for the loss function. Supported values
      include `token-mean`, `sequence-mean-token-mean`,
      `sequence-mean-token-scale`, `seq-mean-token-sum`, and
      `sequence-mean-token-sum-norm`. Default: `sequence-mean-token-mean`.
    reward_manager: The reward manager to use. Default: `sequence-level`.
    loss_algo: use GRPO or GSPO for loss computation. GRPO loss is per-batch
      normalized instead of per-response normalized as mentioned in the paper.
      For GSPO, we use gspo-token loss which is more flexible.
    num_generations: The number of times the policy generates multiple responses
      for a given prompt within a single training step. This corresponds to 'G'
      in Algorithm 1 in the `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300>`_. A
      higher value means more samples are used to compute relative advantages.
    num_iterations: The number of iterations per batch (𝜇 in GRPO algo 1).
    beta: The coefficient for the KL divergence penalty (𝛽) in the GRPO loss
      function. This term prevents policy updates from deviating too far from
      the reference model. A value of 0.0 means no KL penalty is applied.
    kl_loss_mode: The divergence mode used for KL penalty estimation. Default:
      `kl`.
    epsilon: Epsilon value for clipping (𝜀 in GRPO loss in paper). Similar to
      PPO, it ensures stable updates.
    epsilon_high: Epsilon value for upper bound clipping.
    epsilon_c: Dual-clip PPO/GRPO lower bound for clipping when advantages are
      negative.
    use_rollout_logps: Whether to use rollout-side log probabilities as
      old-policy log probabilities. If False, recompute old-policy log
      probabilities on the trainer actor.
    sampler_is: Optional truncated importance-sampling correction between the
      rollout sampler and trainer actor. Set to "token" to use trainer
      recomputed logps as old-policy logps and multiply the policy loss by
      detached per-token sampler/trainer correction weights.
    sampler_is_threshold: Maximum per-token TIS correction weight.
    temperature: Sampling temperature used during rollout generation to compute
      log probabilities and entropy in the loss function.
